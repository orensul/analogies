The plasma membrane encloses the animal cell.
The plasma membrane controls the movement of materials into and out of the cell.
The Nucleus Controls the activities of the cell.
These cellular activities require energy.
The Mitochondria extract energy from food molecules to provide the energy needs of the cell.
Animal cells must also synthesize a variety of proteins and other organic molecules necessary for growth and repair.
Ribosomes Produce these proteins.
The cell may use these proteins or move these proteins out of the cell for use in other cells.
To move organic molecules, the cell contains a complex system of membranes that create channels within the cell.
This system of membranes is called the endoplasmic reticulum.
