1	The plasma membrane encloses the animal cell.
2	The plasma membrane controls the movement of materials into and out of the cell.
3	These cellular activities require energy.
4	The Mitochondria extract energy from food molecules to provide the energy needs of the cell.
5	Animal cells must also synthesize a variety of proteins and other organic molecules necessary for growth and repair.
6	Ribosomes Produce these proteins.
7	The cell may use these proteins or move these proteins out of the cell for use in other cells.
8	To move organic molecules, the cell contains a complex system of membranes that create channels within the cell.
9	This system of membranes is called the endoplasmic reticulum.
